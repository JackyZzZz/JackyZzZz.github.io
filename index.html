                I am a computer science student with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California,
                Irvine. As a Software Engineer Intern at UC Irvine,
                I developed a variety of data management and text analytics projects under the supervision of <a href="https://chenli.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Chen Li</a>
                I also served as a Laboratory Tutor, helping intermediate Python students develop a strong conceptual understanding of the subject.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various projects, including <a href="https://github.com/Texera/texera" target="_blank">Texera</a>,
                a collaborative data analytics platform supporting over 4,000 users worldwide, and the development of the Global Airport App,
                a Python-based GUI application that parses and manages information on over 75,880 airports.
                I also created a <a href="https://github.com/JackyZzZz/BREAKOUT-GAME" target="_blank">Breakout game</a> with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript that supports real-time responsive scoring.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Scala.
                I am also experienced with technologies such as Git, Bash, React, and API development.
                My diverse skill set, strong work ethic, and passion for computer science make me a valuable asset to any team.
