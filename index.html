                a Python-based GUI application that parses and manages information on over 75,880 airports.
                I also created a 2D client/server game with an AI-driven player, showcasing my ability to develop engaging and interactive applications.
                I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Scala.
                I am also experienced with technologies such as Git, Bash, React, and API development.
                My diverse skill set, strong work ethic, and passion for computer science make me a valuable asset to any team.
