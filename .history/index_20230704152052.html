            <p id="Summary">
                I'm Jun Xia, a highly-driven student at the University of California, Irvine, 
                where I'm currently studying Computer Science and Quantitative Economics. 
                I have a firm grounding in Python, R, finance, and statistics, 
                as evidenced by my solid GPA and extensive coursework. 
                Beyond academics, I embrace opportunities to help others navigate the university experience, 
                whether that's leading campus tours or providing mentorship to undeclared students. 
                I'm passionate about learning and regularly engage in online courses to further expand my skill set, 
                such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy the challenge of leadership as well, 
                serving as President of the Career Development Department in our Student Union. 
                I'm fluent in both English and Mandarin and in my spare time, 
                I can be found keeping fit, gaming, or capturing life through a lens.
